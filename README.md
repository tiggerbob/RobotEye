### Why?
One small but mighty benefit of the recent pandemic is a resurgence of incredibly handy online teaching tools, such as [Google Classroom](classroom.google.com) and [Edpuzzle](edpuzzle.com). However, thousands of school districts all around the country are beginning to see a need for not only providing resources for their students, but ensuring those resources are appropriately used. School-issued chromebooks, while essential for children affected by the digital divide, can easily prove to be a cause of distraction for many down the road. 

The solution for this issue is to fight technology with technology: **RobotEye** is a Chrome Extension that provides educators with an easy-to-use platform that logs, tracks, and blocks websites when appropriate. By using non-intrusive technology, parents and staff alike can feel comfortable knowing that no accidental damage will be done to the device itself. In addition, students' online lives won't be affected outside of certain teacher-selected websites, providing full access to required learning material. 

### Features
RobotEye's teacher-student software allows for:
 * Extensive, reliable website blocking
 * Filtering for both domain and subdomain names
 * Easy, "copy-paste" teacher interface structure (see demo)
 * Custom blocked site redirect pages
 * Scalable development efficiency for upwards of thousands of students
 * And much more!
